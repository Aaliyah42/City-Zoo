         <h3>TIGER</h3>
         <p>Tigers are the largest wild cats in the world.</p>
         <p>There are five subspecies of tiger: Bengal, Indochinese, Malayan, Siberian and South China.</p>
         <p>Adults can weigh up to 363kg (that’s about the same as ten ten year olds!) and measure up to 3.3m!Tigers are carnivores, eating only meat.</p>
         <p>They are also territorial and usually solitary in nature, although they can be social animals.</p>
         <p>They mainly feed on large mammals such as deer, wild pigs, antelope and buffalo.</p>
         <p>Tigers are solitary hunters, and generally search for food alone at night.</p>
         <p>They quietly stalk their prey until they are close enough to pounce – then they kill their victim with a bite to the neck or back of the head. Ouch!</p>
         <p>Tigers are good swimmers!</p>
         <p>Unlike most members of the cat family, they like water and often cool off in pools or streams.</p>
