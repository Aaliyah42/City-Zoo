         <h3>KOALAS</h3>
         <p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, known for their adorable appearance and tree-dwelling lifestyle. They primarily feed on eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most other animals.</p>
         <p>Koalas have a unique digestive system that allows them to detoxify the chemicals in eucalyptus leaves, enabling them to thrive on this specialized diet.</p>
         <p>These iconic Australian animals are often mistaken for bears, but they are not bears at all. Koalas are more closely related to kangaroos and wombats.</p>
         <p>Koalas are nocturnal creatures, meaning they are most active at night. During the day, they spend a significant amount of time sleeping in trees to conserve energy.</p>
         <p>Koalas have a distinctive vocalization, often described as a deep, grunting sound.</p>
         <p>It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 60 to 85cm (24 to 33 in) and weighs 4 to 15 kg (9 to 33 lb). Pelage colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown.</p>
         <p> Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.</p>
         <p><strong> WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
         <p>You will find the koalas next to the giraffe enclosure.</p>
