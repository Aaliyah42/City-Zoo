            <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
            <p> Elephants are the world’s largest land animal! Male African elephants can reach 3m tall and weigh between 4,000 -7,500kg.
                Asian elephants are slightly smaller, reaching 2.7m tall and weighing 3,000– 6,000kg.</p>
             <p>Elephants are herbivores and spend up to 16 hours a day eating. They can consume up to 150kg of food a day, including grass, leaves, bark, roots and fruit.</p>
             <p>Elephants are highly intelligent and social animals. They live in family groups led by a matriarch, usually
             <p> There’s an easy way to tell the African elephants apart from their Asian cousins – their ears! African elephants have large ears shaped like the continent of Africa!
                 Asian elephants’ ears are smaller and shaped like India. Cool, huh?</p> 
             <p>Elephants are known for their incredible memories. They can remember locations, other elephants, and even human faces for many years.</p>
             <p>Elephants communicate using a variety of sounds, including trumpets, rumbles, and even infrasound, which is below the range of human hearing.</p>
             <p>Elephants are also known for their strong social bonds. They often show affection by touching and hugging each other with their trunks.</p>
             <p>Sadly, elephants are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their ivory tusks. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent creatures.</p>  
            <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?.</strong></p>
            <p>You will find the Elephants at pen E23, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
